This is a Python software that runs on a self-checkout machine. A paramount task it performs is the determination of  how much change to provide when the shopper pays for a purchase with cash.
The program begins by reading several cents from the user as an integer. Then would compute and display the denominations of the coins that should be used to give that amount of change to the shopper. The change is given using as few coins as possible. The assumption is that the machine is loaded with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies, and toonies.
